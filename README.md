# Angular JWT Authentication & Authorization Example

## Introduction

Explore a robust Angular application that incorporates JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and authorization. This comprehensive example features the implementation of key security concepts, including HttpOnly cookies and JWT, as well as advanced components such as HttpInterceptor, Router, and Form Validation.

## JWT Authentication

In this project, we delve into the intricacies of JWT authentication, illustrating its seamless integration into both User Registration (Signup) and User Login processes.

## Structured Project Layout

Our codebase is thoughtfully organized, showcasing best practices for Angular project structure. It highlights the use of the powerful HttpInterceptor and Router modules to streamline communication with the server.

## Harnessing the Power of HttpInterceptor

Discover a clean and efficient method of incorporating HttpInterceptor into your application. This invaluable tool simplifies and enhances the interaction between your Angular app and your server, ensuring smooth authentication and authorization.

## Storing JWT Tokens in HttpOnly Cookies

We take security seriously by demonstrating how to securely store JWT tokens within HttpOnly cookies. This approach ensures the utmost protection of sensitive user data while streamlining authentication.

## Creating User Login and Signup Components

The example provides an in-depth walkthrough of creating Login and Signup components, complete with robust form validation. You'll learn how to handle user input, data submission, and validation in a user-friendly manner.

## Accessing Protected Resources

Unlock the potential of Angular components designed to access protected resources. We'll guide you through the process of securely interacting with sensitive data and features within your application.

## Dynamic Navigation Bar Integration

Enhance user experience with the dynamic integration of a navigation bar into your Angular app. Our guide offers an elegant solution for creating a responsive navigation system that adapts to user permissions.

## Seamless Browser Session Management

Learn how to effectively manage user sessions within the browser through the utilization of session storage. This ensures a smooth and secure experience for your application's users.

## User Registration and Login Workflow

Discover the seamless workflow for User Registration and Login, underpinned by JWT-token-based authentication and a RESTful API. We delve into the inner workings of:

1. User Registration: A secure process facilitated through a POST request to the `api/auth/signup` endpoint.

2. User Login: An efficient and secure method of accessing your application's features, executed via a POST request to the `api/auth/signin` endpoint.

3. User Logout: Ensuring secure user logout with a POST request to the `api/auth/signout` endpoint.

Join us on this journey to master Angular JWT authentication and authorization, making your applications more secure and user-friendly than ever before.
